/**
 * The unit of inking (spec 02 §5.1). Holds the raw samples plus a snapshot of
 * the tool style; the ribbon geometry is derived from the samples on demand and
 * cached until the samples change.
 *
 * Samples live in parallel primitive arrays, not a `List<Sample>`: a dense note holds millions of
 * them, and one boxed 4-double object per sample costs ~60 bytes against the 12 the numbers need.
 * Positions are **offsets from [ox]/[oy]**, a per-stroke double origin taken at pen-down, so a
 * float never has to carry a large absolute coordinate — the infinite canvas has no coordinate
 * bound, and float32 spacing reaches a whole pixel around 1e7. An offset spans one stroke, a few
 * hundred px at most, where float resolves to ~1e-5 px. [samples] is a read-only view over the
 * arrays for the cold call sites; the hot loops read [xAt]/[yAt]/[pAt] and allocate nothing.
